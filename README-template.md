## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 display: grid; to create a two dimensional colum
 grid template areas: "a b c"; to define the positions of each grid item
 letter spacing : -1px; to reduce the spacing btn letters
}

.grid-sections :nth-child(1){} to select the first chile of the class;
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I'm struggling with css grid and i'll like to revisit such area and try to perfect my skills;
